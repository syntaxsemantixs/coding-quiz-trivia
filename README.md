## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a quiz that can take the user from queston to question. While also keep track of the high scores. This was to help learn different methods for API's. Some examples include querySelector, createElement and getAtrribute. Also this helps to learn how to store items locally and render them. This solves the process of creating a site completely on the front end. Moving from button to screen. I used the CSS display none and block to help show and hide the different HTML elements through classes and IDs. I learned that many functions are used to navigate a site if it is only in the frontend.
